    "Choose any graph in the Introduction of Storytelling With Data.  Using matplotlib to reproduce it in a rough way.  I don't expect you to spend an enormous amount of time on this; I understand that you likely will not have time to re-create every feature of the graph.  However, if you're excited about learning to use matplotlib, this is a good way to do that.  You don't have to duplicate the exact values on the graph; just the same rough shape will be enough.  If you don't feel comfortable using matplotlib yet, do the best you can and write down what you tried or what Google searches you did to find the answers."
